The \"Butterfly Effect\" describes the sensitivity of a system to initial conditions and predicting its long term behavior. It is the notion of a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil, creating profound weather changes causing a tornado in Texas. Our mission is to create meaningful change with a lasting effect in the lives of those who we work with.\r\n\r\nFocusing on intervention and services for individuals with developmental and learning disorders our centralized platform gives both caregivers and providers the ability to completely manage therapies and programs. Our directory of professionals offer various therapeutic approaches all designed to improve the lives of the individuals they work with.\r\n\r\nOur directory also includes professionals certified in the Butterfly Effects Pathways™ methodology. These providers actively subscribe to and are committed to continually researching the effectiveness of all treatment and therapy options. This research is then analyzed and compiled. We utilize this research to increase the effectiveness of all treatment and therapy options creating ‘pathways’ to overcoming developmental and learning problems.\r\n\r\nOur Mission Statement\r\n\r\nOur company was founded upon one important statement, ‘develop ways to truly create change within the lives of the children that we serve’. This meant that the current tools and philosophies being used to work with children had to be improved, especially in the areas of collaboration and accountability.\r\n\r\nThe web has spurred innovation and communication like no other medium before, allowing for an open platform of trans-disciplinary care amongst parents, caregivers and providers.\r\n\r\nIt is our mission here at Butterfly Effects (along with our network of providers) to analyze and evaluate each and every treatment and therapy option and provide a continually self improving path for caregivers and providers to follow.\r\n\r\nOur History\r\n\r\nButterfly Effects began as an agency providing naturalized environment based therapy services to children with Autism Spectrum Disorders across South Florida. Charlotte Fudge, the company\'s CEO, witnessed the overwhelming need for infrastructure to support community providers in effective, evidence based service delivery. She set out to build a network of providers committed to accountability and collaboration, working remotely across community settings. With the enlisted help of some very dedicated individuals, Butterfly Effects has grown to a company of over 100 dedicated employees with new team members joining each day.','http://www.butterflyeffects.com/','no','no','yes','no','no','no',0.00,'2010-11-23','2010-12-01 15:03:59','66.176.150.55','baa27f6013badc835c69',1,0,'0000-00-00','',0,'E','1','',0,'english','0000-00-00','no','a:3:{s:11:\"job_confirm\";s:2:\"no\";s:10:\"job_expire\";s:3:\"yes\";s:9:\"job_renew\";s:2:\"no\";}',26,'','',0,0),(3543,3543,'cgonzalez@pro-xpect.com','2CiFEjoLMjY=','Pro-Xpect,LLC','Christina Gonzalez','3535 W.

In its first year,  Lithia  had five employees who sold 14 vehicles. Following Walt\'s death in 1968, Sid DeBoer (eldest son in a family of six children) reorganized and took control of the small Chrysler-Dodge store.\r\n                          \r\n                        \r\nIn 1970, Sid purchased the Dodge Center in Medford, shifting operations from Ashland, to the largest market in the area. Dick\r\nHeimann, then with the Chrysler Corporation, had formed a strong working relationship with Sid. As a result, Sid convinced Dick Heimann to leave his position with Chrysler and join him in running the Medford store. Since then Lithia has grown from a single store into a successful group of franchised auto-retail stores.\r\n                         \r\n                     \r\n                        	From 1970 to 1990 Lithia experienced substantial growth to a total of 5 stores and 19 franchises in the Southern Oregon area. It is in these stores that the \"Lithia\" operating model was developed.

Here are some additional tips to help you optimize your search: \n \n    Job titles are best:  Searching for a specific job title provides more accurate results than company names or other keywords.  software engineer  is better than  coder , and  registered nurse  is better than  hospital . \n    Zip code can help narrow your location:  For location, a zip code is generally more precise than entering city, state. \n	  You can use quotes:  Surround multiple terms in quotes to treat them as a phrase, like:  \"program manager\" or \"dental hygenist\".  \n	  You can exclude certain terms:  Enter a minus sign before any terms you want to exclude, like:  -travel or -\"entry level\".  \n    You can require certain terms:  Enter a plus sign before any terms you want to require, like:  +full-time or +\"full benefits\".  \n         \n          Got it, thanks! \n        \n      \n \n',0,0,500,1,NULL,'0','4',NULL,'Bloomington','MN',NULL,NULL,'2015-06-29','2015-06-29','eng',NULL,0,'HealthPartners',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-07-09',1,0,0,NULL,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'no','R','-93.260','44.960','ziprecruiter','https://www.ziprecruiter.com/ojob/a4dec78f10c0dd2fbdaf24d5a0a2f41f/?cat=project-program-management&mid=278&source=directemployersassociation_cpc',2,NULL,NULL,'N'),(31128842,0,'Urgent Locums Need 45 minutes South of Columbus','&nbsp;  \n         \n           \n             \n                   home \n             | \n             \n                   sign in                                           \n             \n             | \n              help  \n             | \n              careers with us  \n           \n             \n         \n       \n\n\n\n   \n       \n         \n            Register  \n               \n                    Physicians and CRNAs  \n                    Healthcare Facilities  \n                    Agency Recruiters  \n               \n            \n        \n           &nbsp; \n            \n            Physicians and CRNAs  \n               \n                    Search For Jobs  \n                    Sign Up  \n                    Career Centers  \n                       \n                            Anesthesiology Career Center  \n                            Critical Care Career Center  \n                            CRNA Career Center  \n                            Emergency Medicine Career Center  \n                            Family Practice Career Center  \n                            Hospitalist Career Center  \n                            Internal Medicine Career Center  \n                            Neurology Career Center  \n                            Oncology Career Center  \n                            Pediatrics Career Center  \n                            Psychiatry Career Center  \n			                Psychology Career Center  \n                            Radiology Career Center  \n                            Surgery Career Center  \n                       \n                   \n                    Physician Resources  \n                    Conventions  \n                    Why Use\n                  a LocumTenens.com Recruiter?

Here are some additional tips to help you optimize your search: \n \n    Job titles are best:  Searching for a specific job title provides more accurate results than company names or other keywords.  software engineer  is better than  coder , and  registered nurse  is better than  hospital . \n    Zip code can help narrow your location:  For location, a zip code is generally more precise than entering city, state. \n	  You can use quotes:  Surround multiple terms in quotes to treat them as a phrase, like:  \"program manager\" or \"dental hygenist\".  \n	  You can exclude certain terms:  Enter a minus sign before any terms you want to exclude, like:  -travel or -\"entry level\".  \n    You can require certain terms:  Enter a plus sign before any terms you want to require, like:  +full-time or +\"full benefits\".  \n         \n          Got it, thanks! \n        \n      \n    \n  \n          \n  \n',0,0,500,1,NULL,'0','4',NULL,'Portland','OR',NULL,NULL,'2015-06-29','2015-06-29','eng',NULL,0,'Bob Thomas CARSTAR',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-07-09',1,0,0,NULL,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'no','R','-122.688','45.499','ziprecruiter','https://www.ziprecruiter.com/jobs/bob-thomas-carstar-5282ed0d/auto-body-estimator-388b2c95?',2,NULL,NULL,'N'),(31128846,0,'Mechanic','Mechanic \r\n             \r\n         \r\n     \r\n     \r\n         \r\n             \r\n                 \r\n                    Enter Your Email Address \r\n                 \r\n                     \r\n                \r\n             \r\n        \r\n             \r\n                 Email me Jobs \r\n             \r\n                                 \r\n                    By continuing you agree to Monster\'s  Privacy policy ,  Terms of use  and  use of cookies .\r\n             \r\n            \r\n         \r\n     \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n             \r\n        \r\n         \r\n              \r\n             Let The Jobs Come To You \r\n         \r\n        \r\n         Enter your email address below to receive jobs like this sent to your email. \r\n         \r\n             Send Jobs Similar To \r\n              Mechanic  \r\n\r\n             \r\n                 \r\n                    Email Address\r\n                 \r\n                 \r\n                \r\n             \r\n        \r\n             \r\n                    By continuing you agree to Monster\'s  Privacy policy ,  Terms of use  and  use of cookies .\r\n             \r\n\r\n             \r\n                 \r\n             \r\n         \r\n        \r\n        \r\n     \r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n     \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n	 \r\n     \r\n          \r\n         \r\n             Thank you for your interest in the Mechanic.

Here are some additional tips to help you optimize your search: \n \n    Job titles are best:  Searching for a specific job title provides more accurate results than company names or other keywords.  software engineer  is better than  coder , and  registered nurse  is better than  hospital . \n    Zip code can help narrow your location:  For location, a zip code is generally more precise than entering city, state. \n	  You can use quotes:  Surround multiple terms in quotes to treat them as a phrase, like:  \"program manager\" or \"dental hygenist\".  \n	  You can exclude certain terms:  Enter a minus sign before any terms you want to exclude, like:  -travel or -\"entry level\".  \n    You can require certain terms:  Enter a plus sign before any terms you want to require, like:  +full-time or +\"full benefits\".  \n         \n          Got it, thanks! \n        \n      \n \n',0,0,500,1,NULL,'0','4',NULL,'Fort Mill','SC',NULL,NULL,'2015-06-29','2015-06-29','eng',NULL,0,'Citi',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-07-09',1,0,0,NULL,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'no','R','-80.994','35.041','ziprecruiter','https://www.ziprecruiter.com/ojob/1ce905106f1b96a812d8b30295bb1c5b/?cat=accounting-finance-insurance&mid=278&source=directemployersassociation_cpc',2,NULL,NULL,'N'),(31128869,0,'Part Time Technology Teacher','Part Time Technology Teacher \n     \n       \n            KidTech LLC \n             San Antonio ,  TX    \n       \n      \n         \n           \n           \n         \n      \n      \n      Posted 4 days ago  in  Education  \n\n     \n\n \n           \n         \n\n\n \n       \n     \n       \n        \n     \n      ~~We are looking for an excellent, computer literate teacher, to train in summer camps; then stay on in the fall to teach computer classes in the afternoons, during the school year.

Here are some additional tips to help you optimize your search: \n \n    Job titles are best:  Searching for a specific job title provides more accurate results than company names or other keywords.  software engineer  is better than  coder , and  registered nurse  is better than  hospital . \n    Zip code can help narrow your location:  For location, a zip code is generally more precise than entering city, state. \n	  You can use quotes:  Surround multiple terms in quotes to treat them as a phrase, like:  \"program manager\" or \"dental hygenist\".  \n	  You can exclude certain terms:  Enter a minus sign before any terms you want to exclude, like:  -travel or -\"entry level\".  \n    You can require certain terms:  Enter a plus sign before any terms you want to require, like:  +full-time or +\"full benefits\".  \n         \n          Got it, thanks! \n        \n      \n    \n  \n          \n  \n',0,0,500,1,NULL,'0','4',NULL,'Indianapolis','IN',NULL,NULL,'2015-06-29','2015-06-29','eng',NULL,0,'Encore Search Partners, LLC',NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-07-09',1,0,0,NULL,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'no','R','-86.108','39.775','juju','https://www.ziprecruiter.com/jobs/encore-search-partners-llc-183c767d/electrical-engineer-commercial-buildings-lansing-mi-id-723-1f45a89e?mid=37a39005&source=cpc-',2,NULL,NULL,'N');
